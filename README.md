The first laboratory work in a cycle on the subject of User Interface Development

# Graph Rendering

This is a student project in which it is necessary to implement algorithms for breadth-first search and depth-first search on graphs, as well as their rendering. Programming language is Python 3.7

## Installation

In order for our program to work after downloading, you must additionally install a third-party library. To download, follow this link [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/). When installing, add the path to graphviz in PATH

## Results of the program
In the process, two graph traversal algorithms were implemented. Each time the program is run, a new random graph is always generated with the number of vertices not exceeding 10. Then the steps begin to be drawn depending on which algorithm is selected. In the breadth-first graph traversal, each layer is marked with its own specific color.

```python
  # Algorithms.DFS(graph, visited, 0)
    Algorithms.BFS(graph, visited, 0)
```
